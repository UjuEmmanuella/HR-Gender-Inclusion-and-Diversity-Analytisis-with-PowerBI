## Problem Statement

Organizations face ongoing challenges in:

* Translating diversity intentions into measurable, data-driven progress

* **Data:** HR dataset containing employee information such as gender, hiring dates, promotions, performance ratings, and turnover status
* **Scope:** 500 rows and 32+ columns representing employee journeys within the company, used to explore gender gaps in leadership and advancement

### Methodology

- **Data Import and Cleaning:** Imported HR data into Power BI and cleaned inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values.

- **Data Preparation:** Structured data with hierarchies for easy time-based trend analysis.

- **DAX Analysis:** Created custom measures to calculate promotion rates, hiring ratios, turnover, and performance by gender.

- **Visualization:** Built clear dashboards and charts to tell a meaningful story about gender diversity challenges.
